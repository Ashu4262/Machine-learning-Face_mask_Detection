## Introduction

Welcome to the Face Mask Detection project! This initiative aims to develop an advanced and reliable system to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks, leveraging the power of computer vision and machine learning. This technology has gained significant importance in ensuring public health and security.

## Objectives üéØ
1. Public Health and Safety: Enhance measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne diseases by ensuring compliance with mask mandates in real-time.
2. Operational Efficiency: Automate the process of monitoring mask compliance, reducing the need for manual checks and allowing better resource allocation.
3. Security Enhancement: In high-security environments like ATMs and banks, detect individuals wearing masks to aid in identity verification and prevent fraudulent activities.
4. Scalability: Deploy the model across various settings, from small retail stores to large transportation hubs, ensuring broad and consistent compliance with mask-wearing policies.
## Project Overview üìù
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of images with and without masks.
2. Data Preprocessing: Resize and normalize images to improve model performance.
3. Model Training: Use a CNN to train the model, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Real-Time Detection: Implement the system to operate efficiently in real-time scenarios across various environments.
## Graphical User Interface (GUI) üñ•Ô∏è
We have developed a user-friendly GUI to interact with the face mask detection model. Users can easily upload images and get immediate feedback on whether a mask is detected or not. This enhances the usability of the system and allows for seamless interaction without needing to write any code.

## Practical Applications üåç
1. Public Spaces: Enhance safety in airports, hospitals, workplaces, retail spaces, educational institutions, public transport, and large events.
2. Smart Cities: Integrate with IoT devices for real-time monitoring and enforcement of public health guidelines.
3. Remote Health Monitoring: Ensure safety protocols during telemedicine consultations.
## Future Work üöÄ
The future focus will be on improving real-time processing capabilities and expanding the model's applicability to broader contexts. This project demonstrates the versatility and importance of face mask detection technology in promoting public health and safety.
